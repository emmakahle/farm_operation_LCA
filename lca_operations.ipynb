    "### Tyler's vision:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The simple model I want to build first is to take a Big Ag operation for wheat, and calculate the carbon lost from the soil by using non-regenerative practices, as well as the hypothetical carbon emissions from shipment. You could start with 1 acre, and trace it through the supply chain. So its 1) carbon loss for big ag farming compared to local ecosystem storage, 2) emissions to harvest wheat, 3) average emissions to ship wheat to largest cities in USA, based on percentage of shipment correlated with population of cities. And whatever else I have forgotten to mention, and then you can scale up from 1 acre accordingly. Then, I want to compare that with a regenerative farm shipping only to the nearest city. How much carbon emissions are avoided? How much carbon can be sequestered, and is this more than the surrounding ecosystem? What is the break even point to grow carbon neutral food? What would it take to be carbon negative? Those plots will be valuable to grow our business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should be able to scale up or down in acreage, shipping distance, and regenerative ag benefits. I want the model to include residential nanofarming at some point. I also want to show that if we reach X amount of acres of grain (or whatever), and shipping distance is reduced by X percent, and we get X gains from regenerative ag, what sort of impact can we have? We would have to develop a few variables to account for different regenerative practices (compost, no till, cover crop, silvopasture, native grassland, new trees, rotational grazing, etc). And then, if more people do this in other states, what sort of gain do we get.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we have on farm emissions (from growing and harvesting) and distribution emissions."

    "- Tillage (fuel to prepare field, release of carbon from soil disturbance)\n",
    "- Planting seed (fuel to plant, carbon required to transport seed to farm)\n",
    "- Chemical inputs (fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, fungicide: emissions from production, transport, application)\n",
    "- Compost\n",
    "- Growing plants (carbon sequestration - how does this depend on regen practices?)\n",
    "- Harvesting plants (fuel required to harvest)\n",
    "- Winter cover crops (fuel to plant, carbon sequestered)\n",
    "- Other practices to add (silvopasture, native grassland, new trees, rotational grazing)\n",
    "\n",
